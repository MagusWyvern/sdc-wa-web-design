            The #ZeroFoodWastage initiative is part of Sunway's commitment to sustainability.
            Sunway is a leading Malaysian conglomerate with a strong focus on environmental and social responsibility.
            The company has a number of other sustainability initiatives,
            including a renewable energy program, a water conservation program, and a waste management program.

            The #ZeroFoodWastage initiative is a valuable contribution to the fight against food waste. 
            It helps to ensure that food is not wasted, which in turn helps to feed the hungry, 
            promote sustainable agriculture, and mitigate climate change.
