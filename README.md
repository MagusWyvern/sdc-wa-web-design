## Competition Case Study & Website Requirements

The Sustainable Development Goals are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and improve
the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere. The Goals were adopted by all United Nations Member States
in September 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which sets out a 15-year plan to
achieve the Goals and their related targets. Never before had world leaders pledged common action across such
a broad and universal policy agenda.

The 17 Goals are interconnected, apply to all countries, and need to be carried out by all stakeholders such as
governments, private sectors, civil societies, the United Nations system and others in the collaborative
partnership. 

Sunway Group intends to continue growing shareholder value meaningfully and responsibly, by actively
contributing to our local communities, harnessing environmentally sustainable technology, and pursuing growth
areas that leverage the strengths of Sunway Group.

Sunway Groupâ€™s four pillars of sustainability are outlined based on the 17 goals under the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDG). This SDG focus on developing and expanding renewable energy
resources such as sun, wind, hydropower, liquid and solid biofuels, biogas and geothermal. These renewable
sources of energy do not emit greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere and therefore are ideal for the
environment and human health.

Sunway Pyramid, one of the most well-known and substantial malls in Malaysia, is working hard to meet the
underlined sustainable development objectives too. Their initiatives include, among others:

1. Food CPR - Compost. Plant. Reduce
2. Metal Straw Campaign
3. Recycling Station
4. Run-happy With Brooks
5. Saving the Earth, One Pack at A Time with Milo

Unfortunately, not many patrons, visitors, or users are aware of these initiatives. Most of the time, it goes
unnoticed by users.

Therefore, you are required to develop a website using HTML 5 and CSS technologies to promote and create
awareness of the SDG initiatives. The SDG initiative is narrowed down to THREE (3) goals (as illustrated below).
Your website needs to have the following features:

1. Details about each of the initiatives

2. Information about where, when, and how to participate in these programmes.

3. Reminding and alerting the users on special programmes/campaigns of SDG on specific dates.

Be creative in delivering the information to users through your website, remember the goal of the website is to
attract more participants for these SDG initiatives by Sunway Pyramid.
