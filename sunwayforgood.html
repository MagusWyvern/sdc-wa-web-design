        <p>
            Sunway for Good is a corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme by the Sunway Group.
            The programme was launched in 2017 with the aim of "creating a better tomorrow for all".
        </p>
        <p>
            Sunway for Good focuses on four key areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Education: The programme provides scholarships, educational resources, and training to underprivileged
                children and youth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Healthcare: The programme supports cancer awareness and research, and provides access to healthcare for
                the underprivileged.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sustainability: The programme promotes sustainable living practices and environmental protection.
            </li>
            <li>
                Community development: The programme supports community development initiatives that promote social
                inclusion and economic empowerment.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Sunway for Good has a number of impact measurement tools in place to track its progress.
            These tools include surveys, focus groups, and impact evaluations. The programme has also been recognised
            by a number of international organisations, including the United Nations Global Compact and the World
            Economic Forum
        </p>
        <p>
            Sunway for Good is an example of how a large corporation can use its resources to make a positive impact on
            society.
            The programme has helped to improve the lives of thousands of people, and it is a testament to the Sunway
            Group's commitment
            to social responsibility.
