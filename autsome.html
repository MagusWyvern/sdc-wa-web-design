        <p>
            Autsome, or Autism Is Awesome, is a program by Sunway Malls that aims to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment 
            for people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The program offers a number of features and benefits, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Autism Friendly Shopping Day: Every Tuesday, Sunway Putra Mall and Sunway Carnival Mall 
                reduce their ambient lighting by 30% and background music by 70%,
                creating a quieter and more peaceful environment for shoppers with ASD. 
                The malls also provide reserved parking for Autsome members and offer special discounts with participating outlets.</li>
            <li>Calm Rooms: Both Sunway Putra Mall and Sunway Carnival Mall have designated Calm Rooms 
                where people with ASD can go to relax and de-stress. 
                The rooms are equipped with calming sensory features, such as soft lighting, comfortable seating, 
                and noise-canceling headphones.</li>
            <li>Inclusive Training: Sunway Malls has trained their staff on how to better interact with people with ASD. 
                This training includes information on ASD, how to create a more inclusive environment, 
                and how to respond to common behaviors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The Autsome program has been praised by parents and caregivers of children with ASD. 
            They have said that the program has made it easier for their children to enjoy shopping and other activities at the mall. 
            The program has also helped to raise awareness of ASD and to promote greater acceptance of people with the condition.
        </p>
