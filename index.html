            The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet,
            and improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere. The 17 Goals were adopted by all United Nations
            Member States in September 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which sets out a
            15-year plan to achieve the Goals and their related targets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sunway Group is committed to supporting the SDGs by actively contributing to local communities, harnessing
            environmentally sustainable technology, and pursuing growth areas that align with the strengths of the
            company.

        <p>Having touched the lives of over half a million beneficiaries under the #SunwayforGood umbrella, Sunway
            will celebrate its 50th year in 2024 with four goals covering ongoing CSR initiatives in education, food
            security, healthcare and the environment.</p>
        <p>Named as among the top 10 most attractive employers to work for in Malaysia by Randstad Malaysia in 2021,
            and the first Malaysian conglomerate to win three best employer awards at the Aon Best Employers
            Malaysia in 2018, Sunway has always put People first.</p>
        <p>In 2020, Sunway Education Group launched 42KL, the first campus of its kind in Southeast Asia with a
            disruptive peer-to-peer educational model.</p>
        <p>Sunway REIT, along with Sunway Berhad and Sunway Construction were among the first few Malaysian firms to
            join 1,700 organisations worldwide in supporting the recommendations of the Task Force on
            Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).</p>
        <p>In 2023, Sunway REIT became the country’s first Real Estate Investment Trust to introduce a Green Lease
            Partnership Programme for tenants and hotel lessees.</p>
        <p>Sunway was the only Malaysian conglomerate to win Malaysia’s Best Managed Companies in 2021 by global
            consulting firm Deloitte for its strong brand management, progressive corporate strategy and speed of
            growth.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Sunway continues to transform the business landscape in Malaysia.</p>
        <p>By 2050, Sunway aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions, through a set of 19 targets in five goals.
            This includes transforming its portfolios to be low carbon sustainable cities, advocating a responsible
            value chain, developing a safe, equal and dignified workforce, investing in community exclusivity, as
            well as respecting ethical principles.</p>
