            Sunway Pyramid's Food CPR initiative aims to reduce food waste, promote sustainable farming practices, and
            raise awareness about the importance of composting. Through this initiative, Sunway Pyramid collaborates
            with
            local communities, restaurants, and food vendors to manage food waste efficiently and turn it into compost.
        </p>
        <p>
            Compost produced from food waste is used to enrich soil in community gardens and green spaces. This supports
            urban farming and contributes to a greener environment while reducing the carbon footprint of the mall and
            its
            partners.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visitors to Sunway Pyramid are encouraged to participate by segregating food waste at dedicated composting
            bins and learning about sustainable gardening practices at workshops and events organized as part of the
            Food
            CPR campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through the Food CPR initiative, Sunway Pyramid envisions a future where sustainable practices become
            ingrained in our daily lives, creating a positive impact on the community and the planet.
